# type-B

*Where words go to escape the cloud.*

A minimalist text editor that remembers nothing and forgets everything. Built for writers who value privacy over persistence.

## What is type-B?

type-B is a distraction-free text editor that lives entirely in your browser. No accounts. No cloud. No tracking. Just you and your words in a clean, focused environment.

## Features

- **Zero persistence** - Close the tab, and your work vanishes. By design.
- **Auto-save to session** - Your work survives refreshes but dies with the tab
- **Markdown support** - Syntax highlighting and live preview for .md files
- **Dark mode first** - Forged in darkness, tolerates light
- **Minimal UI** - Everything hides until you need it
- **File operations** - Load and save .txt and .md files locally
- **Vintage aesthetics** - Block cursor and monospace font for that terminal feel

## Tech Stack

- Pure web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- No framework dependencies
- No build process
- No tracking or analytics
- No backend required

## Running type-B

Simply open `index.html` in a modern browser. That's it.

For the best experience:
- Use a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave)
- Enable JavaScript
- Allow local file access for save/load operations

## Design Philosophy

type-B believes that not everything needs to be saved forever. Sometimes you just need a clean space to think, write, and then let go. It's a conscious choice against the endless accumulation of digital artifacts.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl/Cmd + S` - Save current document
- `Ctrl/Cmd + O` - Open file
- `Ctrl/Cmd + N` - New document (with warning)
- `Tab` - Insert tab character
- All standard text editing shortcuts work as expected

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+

## Install as App

Want type-B always one click away? Install it as a standalone app:

Chrome/Edge: Click the install icon in the address bar â†’ Install
Safari: File â†’ Add to Dock
Firefox: Limited support, varies by version
Mobile: Tap share â†’ Add to Home Screen

Once installed, type-B launches without browser chrome - just you and the void.
